    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Though I&rsquo;ve been playing with Python and JS for a while, getting into systems programming is one of the things I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. The increased talks about Rust in the IRC (in the previous months), followed by the release of Rust 1.0 gave me a kickstart, which took me into Rust about two weeks back.</p>

<p>I got to see the beauty of Rust (thanks to the <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">wonderful book</a>) and I immediately liked it - its syntax, static type system, vast compile-time checking, etc., especially how it tackles the problem of memory safety by introducing a new concept called <strong>ownership</strong> and it does all those without the use of a garbage collector.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll try to explain what I liked about Rust. The upcoming ones are reserved for topics like FFI and concurrency, and how I got around some of the worst situations I&rsquo;ve experienced as a newbie who just into the systems programming world.</p>

<h2>What I&rsquo;d been doing?</h2>

<p><em>If you&rsquo;re just interested in the code, please feel free to skip this part.</em></p>

<p>It was quite hard for me at first, to understand how Rust worked. So, I decided to translate one of my Python works to Rust - a private diary I had written in Python<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> about an year back.</p>

<p>As I got to know more and more about Rust, I began to look for ways to make my code more <em>efficient</em>. Honestly, I had to rewrite my entire diary to achieve that. I changed the data structure, the encryption scheme, the options it provided, etc., that one day it got quite big, (~500 lines of code) that I had to shift it to <a href="https://github.com/Wafflespeanut/biographer">a new repository</a>.</p>

<p>I realized that translating the diary is probably a bad idea at this point. Luckily, there was one thing I could offer. My diary supported <em>searching</em> through the encrypted stories. This is where high-level languages suck. So, I decided to integrate Rust into my diary, by writing a library (which can search at lightning speed!). To achieve that, I had two things in mind - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">FFI</a> and concurrency, which Rust handled quite <em>nicely</em>. That&rsquo;s where my life as a <em>Rustacean</em> began.</p>

<h1>Some things I liked&hellip;</h1>

<p><em>I liked a lot of things when I was making the library for my diary, which I&rsquo;ll elaborate in this post. We&rsquo;ll get into FFI and concurrency in future posts (because I&rsquo;ve got a lot of stuff in those topics).</em></p>

<p>The only thing that resembles C++ is how we call the methods or traits from modules (like <code>std::thread</code>). The <strong>syntax</strong> for all the other things are very different and they&rsquo;re the ones which impressed me at the first place. As an example, let&rsquo;s write a function for Caesar cipher.</p>

<p>In Python, we have this simple (yet amusing) list comprehension,</p>

<pre><code class="python">def shift(text, amount):        # and, we have a 256-keyspace Caesar cipher
    return ''.join([chr((ord(char) + amount) % 256) for char in text])
    # assert shift('hello', 5) == 'mjqqt' and shift('mjqqt', 256-5) == 'hello'
</code></pre>

<p>In the case of Rust, I decided to work with bytes rather than strings (as it seemed inefficient)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Anyways, Rust doesn&rsquo;t support comprehension, but the equivalent version is somewhat nice.</p>

<pre><code class="rust">fn shift(text_bytes: &amp;Vec&lt;u8&gt;, amount: u8) -&gt; Vec&lt;u8&gt; {
    text_bytes.iter() // wrap around the boundary if the sum overflows
        .map(|byte| amount.wrapping_add(*byte))
        .collect() }
// we don't have to say `collect::&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;()` explicitly, thanks to Rust's type inference
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m just iterating over the bytes, mapping a function over the values using a closure <code>|byte|</code> and finally collect everything into a vector of 8-bit unsigned integers. Notice the absence of <code>;</code> at the end of the expression. Since the function has a return type denoted by <code>-&gt;</code> (which is a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> in this case), Rust automatically <em>infers</em> this as the result of the function. Then, there are these types for each argument, which brings me to my next favorite thing - <strong>static type system</strong>.</p>

<p>For every argument in the function, Rust expects me to specify the type of the argument (whether it&rsquo;s a <code>u8</code> or <code>&amp;str</code> or <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>), including the result (if any) of the function. This was a bit annoying, but it clearly tells that the coder has to know what type of things he&rsquo;s playing with. Yeah, there are complicated cases where we can&rsquo;t be entirely sure of the type, but Rust offers an elegant <em>workaround</em>.</p>

<p>Rust does <strong>compile-time checking</strong>, so that it reduces a program&rsquo;s runtime as much as possible. So, we can take advantage of this feature by deliberately introducing an error, so that it <em>shouts</em> the type for us when we try to  compile. Now, let&rsquo;s try adding some <em>nonsense</em> to our function,</p>

<pre><code class="rust">fn shift(text_bytes: &amp;Vec&lt;u8&gt;, amount: u8) -&gt; Vec&lt;u8&gt; {
    text_bytes.iter() // wrap around the boundary if the sum overflows
        .map(|byte| amount.wrapping_add(*byte))
        // .collect()
        .blah() }       // note the `blah`
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, Rust doesn&rsquo;t compile! Instead, it shows a nice helpful error<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>Compiling demo v0.0.1 (file:///home/wafflespeanut/Desktop/demo)
src/lib.rs:104:10: 104:16 error: no method named `blah` found for type
`core::iter::Map&lt;core::slice::Iter&lt;_, u8&gt;, [closure src/lib.rs:102:14: 102:47]&gt;`
in the current scope
src/lib.rs:104         .blah()
                     ^~~~~~
error: aborting due to previous error
Could not compile `demo`.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
</code></pre>

<p>It tells us that the type <code>core::iter::Map&lt;core::slice::Iter&lt;_, u8&gt;, [closure ...]&gt;</code> doesn&rsquo;t implement our <code>blah</code> method (by which it&rsquo;s letting us know about the exact type), and it also points to the exact location where it has occurred (the same goes for warnings, which can come out of camel cases, deprecated APIs, unused variables, etc.). This <em>type-shouting</em> was very helpful for me while working with complicated types, specifically when I&rsquo;m not sure about what type I get at some location.</p>

<p>Apart from those, some things were much similar to (but much more powerful than) Python, that sometimes I felt Rust&rsquo;s style as high-level. For example, we can unpack tuples and iterate over things just like we do in Python,</p>

<pre><code class="python">(x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3)   # sequence unpacking
for i in [3, 5, 7]:     # iterating over a list
    print i
</code></pre>

<p>In Rust, <code>let</code> does the same job, and <code>in</code> works more or less the same (in the sense, that it calls the <code>iter()</code> method, just like the <code>iter()</code> in Python). But, you can&rsquo;t search with the <code>in</code> like you do in Python, though. <em>Meh, how much more can you expect from a systems language?</em></p>

<pre><code class="rust">let (mut x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3);  // same unpacking
for i in &amp;[3, 5, 7] {           // iterating directly over a slice
    println!("{:?}", i); }
</code></pre>

<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a <code>mut</code> in <code>x</code>, and you can also notice the <code>&amp;</code> operator in the slice, which brings us to the ultimate weapons of Rust - <strong>mutability</strong> and <strong>ownership</strong>. These are the things that allow Rust to guarantee memory safety<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. By default, variable bindings are <em>immutable</em> in Rust. In order to modify the binding in any way, you should specify it as <code>mut</code>, so that the binding becomes mutable, or else you can&rsquo;t change its value.</p>

<p>Regarding ownership, the concept is that the scope in which a variable is born is its owner. But, unlike other languages, we can transfer the ownership of a scope, so that even the scope (who was once the owner) can no longer access the variable once it&rsquo;s been <em>moved</em>. Here&rsquo;s an example,</p>

<pre><code class="rust">fn own(some: Vec&lt;u8&gt;) { }

fn main() {
    let (x, y) = (vec![1, 2, 3], vec![1, 2, 3]);
    let take = x;       // `take` is the owner of `x`
    own(y);             // `own` function is the owner of `y`
    println!("{:?}", (x, y));   // `println!` can't access both, and we get an error
}
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used a heap-allocated vector here, because string, integers, etc. have the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html"><code>Copy</code></a> trait implemented in them by default, so that even if you try to move those types, only the ownership of the <code>Copy</code> is transferred and so your types are unaffected.</p>

<p>This is why I&rsquo;ve always proceeded with caution when throwing <em>non-copyable</em> types (like vectors) here and there. I don&rsquo;t <em>move</em> the values unless it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. Even then, I carry those inside a function, so that I can return some type back and compensate for the previous owner&rsquo;s <em>loss</em>. For example, here&rsquo;s something, which I call a <em>&ldquo;string extractor&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<pre><code class="rust">fn extract(bytes: Vec&lt;u8&gt;) -&gt; String {  // requires a consumable vector, not a reference!
    String::from_utf8(bytes).unwrap() }

let x = vec![97, 98, 99];
// let x = extract(&amp;x);     // doesn't work!
let x = extract(x);         // `String` compensation for the owner who once owned a vector
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>from_utf8</code> method consumes the vector and returns a <code>String</code>. So, I can&rsquo;t do something like taking a pointer to a vector, because (obviously) a pointer is different from a vector, which (like I said) is checked by Rust in compile-time.</p>

<p>In Rust, things work quite differently when it comes to references (which are often called, <strong>&ldquo;borrowing&rdquo;</strong>), and there are two kinds of them. <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/references-and-borrowing.html#the-rules">Rust has two rules</a> when it comes to borrowing,</p>

<blockquote><p>A variable binding can have only one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a single mutable reference</li>
<li>any number of immutable references</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s the only way we can prevent data races. That being said, we can achieve most of the things using immutable references like <code>&amp;T</code> (where <code>T</code> is some type). I&rsquo;ve used mutable references only when I spawn threads i.e., when things get serious and a lot of threads require mutable references. In such a condition, we can use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code></a> to execute operations safely.</p>

<p>As far as I&rsquo;ve seen, Rust offers various kinds of interesting options to easily get around most of the complex situations. For all the high-level coders out there, if you&rsquo;ve always wanna get into systems programming, then I suggest &ldquo;Rust&rdquo; as a nice start!</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> a very basic thing - it just wrote the story into a file, hexes and shifts the ASCII values (my encryption was just a hexed Caesar cipher). That was the state of it <a href="https://github.com/Wafflespeanut/scripts/blob/8850c831c10955b5c32d2710abfbfef916031792/Memorandum/Diary.py">until about a month ago</a>.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>Rust strings are valid UTF-8 by default, and so <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.from_utf8"><code>from_utf8</code></a> method is likely to throw an error if the bytes are invalid. Also, Rust offers a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html">file-reader</a> for reading the contents as bytes. So, I decided to handle everything (including the search) using bytes rather than strings.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Honestly, Rust is also my first language where I felt <em>happy</em> about errors, because I knew (almost immediately) what I should do next to prevent it.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>Actually, memory safety won&rsquo;t be a problem in these trivial cases, but it&rsquo;s much more important while handling threads. For instance, you can&rsquo;t allow two threads to write over the same data. One of Rust&rsquo;s prime goals is to eliminate such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition">data races</a>. If you&rsquo;re more interested in that, <a href="http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/30/how-rust-achieves-thread-safety/">Manish explains about it</a> in one of his posts.<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
